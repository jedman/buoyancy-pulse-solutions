This is a library for solving the 2D boussinesq equations for some initial buoyancy distribution. 
Boundary conditions in the horizontal can be semi-infinite or periodic. 
The horizontal structure problem is governed by the 1D wave equation, and I solve the IVP exactly using D'Alembert's solution. 
Solution methods implemented for vertical structure  are: 
-- rigid lid normal modes (finite depth) 
to be implemented: 
-- semi-infinite region 'modes' 
-- 'leaky lid' boundary condition
